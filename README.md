#	LCVS

### INTRODUCTION

**LCVS** or Locally Controlled Version System is a version control system only to be used locally. The idea here is to make an application that has a bunch of features that let you create a versioning system but locally. This can be done using existing systems but i wanted to do in go as  a method to understand key core aspects in go.

### Concept

The **LCVS** has a similar approach to that of git but uses a hybrid approach. Instead of delta as in mercurial or as checkpointing in other versioning systems we intend to use a hybrid of both to do the work.
The system has almost the same approaches as git but allows user to store their version of product with description.
